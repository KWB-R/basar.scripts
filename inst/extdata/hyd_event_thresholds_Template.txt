# This file: threshold_events_<station>.txt
#
# This file defines water level (H) and flow (Q) thresholds to be applied within
# different time intervals. Only when both the water level and the flow exceed 
# their corresponding thresholds (Hthreshold and Qthreshold, respectively), they
# are assumed to belong to a "hydraulic event".
#
# You may use kwb.monitoring::createDummyEventThresholdFiles() to create dummy 
# versions of this file for each monitoring station.
